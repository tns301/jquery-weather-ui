 Hello,

This is my Weather Application for freeCodeCamp Portfolio. The Default Location is set to London but you can change it in the settings menu! It was built with jQuery and the Weather API from Yahoo to retrieve the data in a JSON format.

Features:
- Ability to save the settings when the page is reloaded and retrieve the current settings using LocalStorage from HTML5.
- Ability to change the current city.
- Choose from metric or imperial system.
- Choose from 4 themes.
- Ability to chose what information you need to be shown on the first page.
- 9 Day's Forecast.

Thanks,
Stefan
